Description: Aseba is an event-based framework for distributed mobile robots control.
 Its core is a lightweight virtual machine, small enough to run on any 16 bits microcontroller.
 In Aseba, those microcontrollers are linked in a network and all their programs are developed
 and debugged from a single application, Aseba Studio.
